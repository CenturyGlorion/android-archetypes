This projects provides several Maven archetypes for Android. Those archtepyes allows to quickly start a Maven project
to develop an android application.

These artifacts are based on the maven-android-plugin (http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/).

android-quickstart
------------------
The quickstart archetype creates a simple android application ready to be deployed on an android device. It's a pretty simple
way to initiate an android project:

    mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=android-quickstart \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=de.akquinet.android.archetypes
      -DarchetypeVersion=0.9.0-SNAPSHOT \
      -DgroupId=your.company \
      -DartifactId=my-android-application \

You can also set the created 'package' with -Dpackage=your.company.android. By default it uses the groupId.

Once generated, the application is ready to be built and deployed. Start an android emulator, or plug an Android dev phone,
and launch:

    cd my-android-application
    mvn clean install android:deploy

The application will be built and deployed on the device.

The android-with-test
---------------------

This archetype creates a multi-module project containing an android application and a project testing this application
(integration tests).

    mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=android-with-test \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=de.akquinet.android.archetypes \
      -DarchetypeVersion=0.9.0-SNAPSHOT \
      -DgroupId=com.foo.bar
      -DartifactId=my-android-project \
      -Dpackage=com.foo.bar.android

The 'package' value is optional (by default use the groupId). You can also set the targetted Android platform with
-Dplatform=x. By default, it use 7 (android 2.1)

Once generated, the application is ready to be built and tested. Start an android emulator, or plug an Android dev phone,
and launch:

    cd my-android-project
    mvn clean install

The application will be built, then the integration-tests will be built and executed on the Android device.
